    <h2>What languages I know</h2>
    <p>I know 4 languges. I know HTML (Hyper Text Markup language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), PHP and Javascript. HTML is used to make basic websites, CSS is to format the HTML, Javascipt and PHP is used for all types of things. Some things you can use JS for include the backend of websites and web games using Pharser.js. And PHP can be used in the backend of websites as well.</p>

    <h2>How I learn/what I use</h2>
    
      <p> I use <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"
target="_blank">Codecademy (CC)<img src = "Images/CC.png" class = 'logo'><img></a> to learn to code and use <a href="https://replit.com/~" target="_blank">Replit<img src = "Images/Replit.png" class = 'logo'><img></a> as an IDE. CC has a great veritiy of corses for all kinds of languges for free and paid acconts. Reptliy is a great IDE because it is browser based so if you want to code on a school computer or somthing you can because you dont need to download anything.

        <br>
        <br>

I use HTML and CSS on the daily and use Javascript sometimes.

      <h2>My goals</h2>

      <p>My goals for my coding career are
        <br>
        1. Become a better web developer
        <br>
        2. Learn more languges
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> These are my goals because I would love to make even better websites. And for my second goal is because I want to learn more languges to make stand alone apps/games.</p>
