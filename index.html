        <h2>About Me</h2>
      </header>
          <p>I am a kid in school that loves coding. I first started to learn to code at the begining of 2020. But all I learned was a little bit of basic JS. But in Augast 2021 I really got into coding and started to learn a lot. Since then I have learned HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. And I am currently learning Python. I have also joined the <a href = "https://discuss.codecademy.com/u/ethanmasterprogram/summary">codecademy forums</a> and been promoted to the second hightest trust level TL3 or Super User(SU)</p>
      
      <header>
        <h2>What languages I know</h2>
      </header>
   
         <p>I know 5 languges. I know HTML (Hyper Text Markup language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), PHP, Javascript and Python. HTML is used to make basic websites, CSS is to format the HTML, Javascipt and PHP is used for all types of things. Some things you can use JS for include the backend of websites and web games using Pharser.js. And PHP can be used in the backend of websites as well. Python can be used for just about anything.</p>
        <header>
          <h2>What I use</h2>
        </header>
            <p> I use <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"
            target="_blank">Codecademy (CC)<img src = "Images/CC.png" class = 'logo' alt="Codecademy logo"></a> to learn to code and use <a href="https://replit.com/~" target="_blank">Replit<img src = "Images/Replit.png" class = 'logo' alt="Replit logo"></a> as an IDE. CC has a great veritiy of corses for all kinds of languges for free and paid acconts. Reptliy is a great IDE because it is browser based so if you want to code on a school computer or somthing you can because you dont need to download anything.
   
            <br>
            <br>
   
            I use HTML, CSS and Javascript on the daily.

          <h2>My goals</h2>
        </header>
   
          <p>My goals for my coding career are
            <br>
            1. Become a better web developer
            <br>
            2. Learn more languges
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p> These are my goals because I would love to make even better websites. And for my second goal is because I want to learn more languges to make stand alone apps/games.</p>
